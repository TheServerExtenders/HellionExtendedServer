**The new Development branch in the Git repository contains the latest working code for the server.**  
**Its almost ready for an actual release, but can be used by server owners who know how to clone** 
**and run a build operation. And who knows that it could potentionally mess up their current server! We dont want to create an actual release for the Development branch at this moment but this will change soon.**
